## Project Structure

### Key Directories

- `src/app`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - `(public)`: Public-facing routes
  - `account`: Customer account pages
  - `artist`: Artist dashboard
  - `admin`: Admin dashboard
  - `auth`: Authentication pages

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components
  - `ui`: Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  - `product`: Product-related components
  - `checkout`: Checkout-related components
  - `artist`: Artist dashboard components
  - `admin`: Admin dashboard components
  - `layout`: Layout components (headers, footers, etc.)

- `src/lib`: Utility functions and shared code

### Key Files

- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Root layout with theme provider
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Home page
- `src/app/artist/layout.tsx`: Artist dashboard layout
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`: Admin dashboard layout
- `src/components/admin/product-form.tsx`: Product form for admin product management
- `src/components/ui/switch.tsx`: Switch component for toggle functionality

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed Build Error**: Added the missing Switch component required by the account page.
2. **Reorganized Product Management**: Centralized product management in the admin interface.
3. **Updated Artist Dashboard**: Focused on sales metrics for assigned products rather than product management.
4. **Implemented Metadata Handling**: Fixed metadata handling for client components.
5. **Added Artist-Product Assignment**: Implemented functionality to assign products to artists in the admin product form.

## Known Issues

1. **Next.js Version**: The project is using Next.js 14.2.24, which is outdated. Consider upgrading to the latest version.
2. **Client-Side Metadata**: Some pages have metadata exports in client components, which is not supported by Next.js. These should be moved to server components or dedicated metadata files.
3. **Mock Data**: The application currently uses mock data throughout. This will need to be replaced with real API calls.

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Create database schema
   - Implement API endpoints

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implement Supabase authentication
   - Set up protected routes with middleware
   - Implement role-based access control

3. **State Management**:
   - Implement React Query for server state
   - Set up Zustand for client state

4. **Payment Processing**:
   - Integrate Stripe for payment processing
   - Implement checkout flow

5. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy to Vercel
